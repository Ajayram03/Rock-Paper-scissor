# Rock-Paper-scissor
This HTML document creates a simple "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure sets up the page with a centered heading that displays the game title and includes buttons for the user to choose between "rock," "paper," or "scissors." When a button is clicked, the JavaScript function play() is triggered. This function generates a random choice for the computer and compares it with the user's choice to determine the result of the game. The outcome, along with both the user’s and the computer’s choices, is then displayed on the page.

The CSS styles the page to ensure a visually appealing layout. The body of the page features a background image and general text styling. The heading is styled with a background color and rounded corners, and the buttons are customized with a dark background and light text to make them stand out. The results are displayed in a designated section with appropriate margins and font sizes. The .whole class provides a container with a specific width, padding, and background color to center and frame the main content effectively.

Overall, this code offers a user-friendly and attractive interface for playing "Rock, Paper, Scissors" directly in a web browser.
